\chapter{Geometric Phase}
Physical measurements or observations are extracted from quantum mechanical systems in the form of expectation values of hermitian operators $\braket{\psi|\hat{A}|\psi}$.
Eigenvectors of the hamiltonian are only specified up to a phase factor. Expectation values and thereby, the physical observations are unaltered by a transformation of the form 
$\psi \rightarrow e^{i \phi} \psi$. This guage choice can be eliminated by formulating quantum mechanics in terms of guage invariant representations such as density 
matrices $\psi\psi^{\dagger}$. Expectation value of an operator $\hat{A}$ is recast as $\braket{\hat{A}} = tr(\psi\psi^{\dagger}\hat{A})$.

\section{Definition}
Prof. M V Berry studied the adiabatic evolution of a quantum system described by the hamiltonian $\hat{H}(\mathbf{R})$, parameterized by external factors $\mathbf{R}$ -- such as
magnetic field, electric field, etc \cite{berry1984quantal}. The hamiltonian is varied by slowly changing $\mathbf{R}$ from time $t=0$ to $t=T$ such that $\mathbf{R}(0)=\mathbf{R}(T)$. This evolution is
a closed loop in the parameter space. Apart from the adiabatic assumption, we also assume that the energy spectrum is discrete and there are no level crossings or degeneracies in the 
energy spectrum. Using the guage freedom, we enforce single-valuedness on the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian in the parameter space. 
Under the assumptions stated above, eigenvectors of the hamiltonian can be uniquely identified as $\ket{n(\mathbf{R})}$ at each point in parameter space without any ambiguity.
The schrodinger equation is stated in this notation as 
\begin{gather}
 \hat{H}(\mathbf{R}(t))\ket{n(\mathbf{R}(t))} = E(\mathbf{R}(t))\ket{n(\mathbf{R}(t))} \\
 \label{chap_2:timedepschroeq} i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{\psi(t)} = \hat{H}(t)\ket{\psi(t)}
\end{gather} In the case of static time-independent hamiltonian, any state expanded as a linear combination of stationary states is written as
$\ket{\psi(t)} = \sum{c_n e^{-\frac{i E_{n}(t)}{\hbar}} \ket{n}}$. Taking cue from this, the expansion ansatz
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi(t)} = \sum{c_{n}(t) e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{0}^{t}{E_{n}(t) dt}} \ket{n(t)}}
\end{equation} is a valid generalization for a system with a time-dependent hamiltonian. When the ansatz is substituted into Eq. \eqref{chap_2:timedepschroeq}, we obtain
\begin{equation}
  \label{chap_2:coeffslinercomb}\dot{c}_{m}(t) = -c_{m}(t) \Braket{m(t) | \frac{\partial}{\partial t} m(t)} - \sum_{n}{c_{n}(t) e^{i (\theta_n - \theta_m)} \frac{\braket{m(t)|\widehat{\dot{H}}|n(t)}}{E_n - E_m}}
\end{equation} where $\theta_n = \frac{-1}{\hbar}\int_{0}^{t}{E_n(t')\,dt'}$. In the adiabatic limit, the transition probability between states tends to zero.
We ignore the second term in the general solution above to obtain the result
\begin{equation}
 c_{n}(t) = e^{i \gamma_{n}(t)}\,c_{n}(0)
\end{equation} If we started in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian $\ket{\psi(0)} = \ket{n(\mathbf{R}(0)}$, then the state evolves as
\begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi(t)} = e^{i \gamma_{n}(t)} e^{i \theta_{n}(\mathbf{R}(t))} \ket{n(\mathbf{R}(t))}
\end{equation} remaining in the $n$th eigenstate all along, only picking up phase factors. In the case of cyclic evolution, we write
\begin{equation}
 \ket{\psi(T)} = e^{i \gamma_{n}(C)} e^{i \theta_{n}(T)} \ket{\psi(0)}
\end{equation}
From Eq. \eqref{chap_2:coeffslinercomb}, we note that
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_{n}(C) = i\,\int_{0}^{T}{\braket{n(t) | \frac{\partial}{\partial t} n(t)}\, dt} = i\, \oint_{c}{\braket{n(\mathbf{R})| \bm{\nabla_{R}} | n(\mathbf{R})} \cdot \, d\mathbf{R}}
\end{equation} $\gamma_{n}(C)$ is a real number and therefore $e^{i \gamma_{n}(C)}$ is a pure phase term. This simple fact can be demonstrated by taking the time-derivative 
of $\braket{n(t)|n(t)} = 1$.
\begin{gather*}
 \braket{n(t)|n(t)} = 1 \\
 \left[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\bra{n(t)}\right]\ket{n(t)} + \bra{n(t)}\left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{n(t)}\right] = 0 \\
 \bra{n(t)}\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{n(t)}\right] = -\left(\bra{n(t)}\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{n(t)}\right]\right)^{*}
\end{gather*}
$\theta_{n}(T)$ is the familiar dynamical phase and $\gamma_{n}(C)$ is known as geometric phase or simply berry phase. While the dynamical phase is a time-dependent quantity,
the geometric phase is a line integral, that only depends on path traversed in the parameter space. Another important observation is the fact that $\gamma_{n}$ is a 
non-integrable quantity as it is not single valued - $\gamma_{n}(0) \neq \gamma_{n}(T)$ in the parameter space. Therefore, the geometric phase cannot be expressed as a field over
the parameter space. By application of stokes theorem, the line integral can be convereted into a surface integral as shown below
\begin{align}
 \gamma_{n}(C) &= i \oint_{C}{\braket{n(\mathbf{R})| \bm{\nabla_{R}} | n(\mathbf{R})} \cdot \, d\mathbf{R}} \nonumber \\
 &= i \int_{S}{\bm{\nabla_{R}} \wedge \braket{n(\mathbf{R})| \bm{\nabla_{R}} | n(\mathbf{R})} \cdot \, d\mathbf{S}} \\
 &= i \int_{S}{(\bm{\nabla_{R}}\bra{n(\mathbf{R})}) \wedge \bm{\nabla_{R}}\ket{n(\mathbf{R})} \cdot \, d\mathbf{S}} \nonumber \\
 \label{chap_2:gaugeindep} &= i \bigintsss_{S}{\,\sum_{m \neq n}{\frac{\braket{n(\mathbf{R})|\bm{\nabla_{R}}\hat{H}(\mathbf{R})|m(\mathbf{R})} \wedge \braket{m(\mathbf{R})|\bm{\nabla_{R}}\hat{H}(\mathbf{R})|n(\mathbf{R})}}{(E_{n}(\mathbf{R})- E_{m}(\mathbf{R}))^2}} \cdot \, d\mathbf{S}}
\end{align}
Eq. \eqref{chap_2:gaugeindep} has a remarkable property of being gauge independent. Any transformation of the form 
$\ket{n(\mathbf{R})} \rightarrow e^{i\delta(\mathbf{R})} \ket{n(\mathbf{R})}$, leaves Eq. \eqref{chap_2:gaugeindep} unchanged. 

\subsection{Anology to electromagnetism}
Before we proceed, it is useful to define two important quantities called the berry connection and the berry curvature. \emph{Berry connection} is defined as
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{A}_{n}(\mathbf{R}) = i\braket{n(\mathbf{R})| \bm{\nabla_{R}} | n(\mathbf{R})}
\end{equation}
and the \emph{Berry curvature} is given by
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{B}_{n}(\mathbf{R}) = i \;\bm{\nabla_{R}} \wedge \braket{n(\mathbf{R})| \bm{\nabla_{R}} | n(\mathbf{R})} = \bm{\nabla_{R}} \wedge \mathbf{A}_{n}(\mathbf{R})
\end{equation} Berry phase is conveniently expressed in terms of these quantities as
\begin{equation}
 \gamma_{n}(C)= \oint_{C}{\mathbf{A}_{n}(\mathbf{R})\cdot \, d\mathbf{R}} = \int_{S}{\mathbf{B}_{n}(\mathbf{R})\cdot \, d\mathbf{S}}
\end{equation}
If we transform the states as $\ket{n(\mathbf{R})} \rightarrow e^{i\delta(\mathbf{R})} \ket{n(\mathbf{R})}$, then the berry connection transforms as
$\mathbf{A}_{n}(\mathbf{R}) \rightarrow \mathbf{A}_{n}(\mathbf{R}) - \bm{\nabla_{R}} \delta(\mathbf{R})$, but the berry curvature remains unchanged. This shows an uncanny
resemblence between magnetic vector potential and the berry connection and consequently the magnetic field strength and the berry curvature. However, it must be kept in mind that
the berry connection and the berry curvature are defined over the parameter space (could be more than 4-dimensional) and not the real space.

Geometric phase was overlooked as physically irrelevant as the expectation values are independent of the phase of eigenfunctions. 
As opposed to the then prevalant notion, Prof. Berry, in his seminal paper, demonstrated that the geometric phase is in fact, physically observable \cite{berry1984quantal,wilczek1989geometric}.
Several assumptions imposed by Prof. Berry in defining the geometric phase can be relaxed and definition of geometric phase has been generalized to nonadiabatic, noncyclic, 
nonunitary and nonabelian situations \cite{aharonov1987phase, samuel1988general, wilczek1984appearance, mukunda1993quantum}.
\section{Bargmann invariants}
% An important result of the adiabatic theorem is, if the system is prepared in a state $\ket{\psi(0)} = \ket{n(\mathbf{R}(0))}$, then at time $t=T$, $\ket{\psi(T)}$ is just a phase 
% factor times $\ket{\psi(0)}$.
% \begin{equation}
%  \ket{\psi(t)} = e^{i\phi_{total}(t)}
% \end{equation}
