\begin{abstract}
Study of quantum hall effect in 2D square lattice driven by oscillatory magnetic field perpendicular to the plane.
The time-dependent hamiltonian is solved in fourier space using Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory, in the high frequency limit.
Investigation of localization/delocalization transitions of time-averaged wavefunctions and calculation of hall conductivity of 
the system using TKNN invariant. Comparison of the results with the effective static hamiltonian picture carried out in the 
previous work.
