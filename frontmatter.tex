\begin{abstract}
Investigation of variants of Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper systems driven by electromagnetic fields in the high frequency limit. A time-independent effective
Hamiltonian is obtained for the models using Floquet theory. The spectrum of the variant models is shown to retain the Hofstadter butterfly structure - a
characteristic property of the pure Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model. The driven models are probed for topological phase transitions - indicators of drastic change in
Hall conductivity. The localization-delocalization transition exhibted by Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper like models is also obtained.
